# Project Vexillum Falsum

A tool for Delta Green, Call of Cthulhu and similar things

The project contains two sections, generators and templates.

## The generators:

- [x] Operation Document Generator
- [x] Operation Name Generator
- [x] Case Number Generator
- [x] Code Name Generator
- [x] Operation Seed Generator

## The templates:

Currently they are not form fillable, and most are still missing

- [ ] Case Sheet (Operation Sheet)
- [x] Night at the Opera (Operation Overview, Operation Structure, Unnatural Entity Details, Ritual Details from Delta Green Handlers Guid)
- [x] COC Tracking sheet ([Based on The Fall of Delta Green Handler's Agent Tracking Sheet](https://pelgranepress.com/2018/04/23/free-downloads-and-resources-for-the-fall-of-delta-green/)) (This will be redone for higher quality)
- [ ] Internal Message
- [ ] Classified Message ([Based on this document by @Travern](https://twitter.com/travern82/status/1205912205629231106))

## Credits:

The idea and process for generating operation names came from user u/Danny-the-K

- Color names are scraped from www.sherwin-williams.com
- Nouns scraped from www.michaelfogleman.com/phrases/

The idea for the code names generator came from u/Imperator_Helvetica and it uses the same list

Case number generator, Internal Message Template and some formatting for the Operation Document Generator came from u/Sax_OFander

Operation Seed Generator uses the Agent backstory seeds from The Delta Green Briefing Document
